## Description

This repository contains a collection of Jupiter notebooks and code exercises I worked on during the IBM Applied Data Science Specialization.
Each folder corresponds to a different course within the program and covers various topics and concepts related to data science and its applications.
Each course focuses on specific aspects of data science, such as data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more.


## Course Content

The IBM Applied Data Science Specialization is a comprehensive program consisting of several courses, including:



### Course 1: Python for Data Science, AI & Development

-  ##### Description:
This repository contains the code and resources for the Python for Beginners course. The course teaches you the basics of Python, a popular programming language used in data science, data analytics, software development, and other fields. This course is suitable for anyone who wants to learn Python, regardless of their prior programming experience. If you are interested in data science, data analytics, software development, or other fields where Python is used, then this course is for you. By the end of this course, you will be able to:
  * Write basic Python programs
  * Use Python data types and structures
  * Control flow and logic
  * Use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Beautiful Soup
  * Perform tasks such as data collection and web scraping with APIs
-  ##### Folder: `1_PythonDataScienceAiDevelopment/`

### Course 2: Python Project for Data Science

-   ##### Description:
This project-based course will help you demonstrate your proficiency in Python for data science. You will work with a real-world dataset and scenario to extract data, web scrape, visualize data, and create a dashboard. This project will showcase your skills in Python and using libraries such as Pandas and Beautiful Soup.

-   ##### Folder: `2_PythonProjectDataScience/`



### Course 3: Data Analysis with Python

-   ##### Description:
This course will teach you how to analyze data with Python, a powerful language for data science. You will learn how to collect and import data, clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations. You will also learn how to predict future trends from data by developing linear, multiple, polynomial regression models & pipelines and learn how to evaluate them.

-   ##### Folder: `3_DataAnalysisPython/`

### Course 4: Data Visualization with Python

-   ##### Description:
This course will teach you how to effectively visualize data with Python, a powerful language for data science. You will learn to create various types of basic and advanced graphs and charts, as well as interactive dashboards. You will also learn how to use data visualization to tell a compelling story and convey insights.

-   ##### Folder: `4_DataVisualizationPython/`



### Course 5: Applied Data Science Capstone

-   ##### Description:
This course is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. In this course, you will apply the skills you have learned in the previous courses to a real-world data science project.

  You will assume the role of a data scientist working for a startup that intends to compete with SpaceX. Your task will be to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. You will use the data science methodology to collect, wrangle, explore, visualize, model, evaluate, and report your results.

  This course is a capstone project, so there will not be much new learning. Instead, you will focus on hands-on work to demonstrate and apply what you have learned in previous courses.
